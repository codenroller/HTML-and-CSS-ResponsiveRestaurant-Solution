                        <h3>Bug Fix Strategy</h3>
                        <p>
                            When fixing the bugs on the original project I was relying on the following rules:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Do not modify the initial html file</li>
                                <li>Modify the original .css file as less as possible</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Bug description:</strong>  the button 'En savoir plus'
                                overlaps with restaurant description text for screens of size smaller
                                than 640px.<br />

                                <strong>Correction:</strong>
                                the media query for screens of size 640px and smaller has been corrected.<br />
                                The string:<br />
                                <span> .resto { min-height: 570px;}</span> <br />
                                was replaced with <br />
                                <span> .resto { padding-bottom: 50px;}</span>
                            </li>

                                <strong>Bug description:</strong> A script for a responsive menu initially
                                has been placed outside  the document body. <br />
                                <strong>Correction:</strong> The script reference was moved to the body section of the document.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Bug description:</strong> 'En savoir plus button overlaps with a restaurant description
                                on screens of size 641px - 768px. <br />
                                <strong>Correction:</strong> 
                                two media queries: (screens with max-width: 640px) and (screens with max-width: 768px) 
                                have been updated.
                                The style for class 'resto' has been removed from the media query for 
                                (screens with max-width: 640px).
                                The style for class 'resto' has been added to the media query for
                                (screens with max-width: 768px):<br />
                                <span> .resto {padding-bottom: 50px}; </span>
                            </li>

                                <strong>Bug description:</strong>
                                Restaurant title block overlaps with address
                                and phone blocks for the screens within the width range of 641px-768px. <br />
                                <strong>Correction:</strong>
                                The decision is to use for this width range
                                the same layout as for the screen widths lower than 640px.
                                When implementing this solution the styles for class='address' and class='tel'
                                were moved from the media query (max-width 640px) to the media query (max width 768px).

                                The site is not behaving responsively for screens of size 769px and approximately 1300px <br />
                                <strong>Correction:</strong> 
                                The additional media query for screens of (max-width 1300px) has been added.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Correction:</strong>
                                The text-alignment of restaurant description text has been changed to justify
                                for all screen sizes.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Bug description:</strong>
                                It is not a bug really, but on the web page the max-width of an image
                                does not exceed 650px. So I decided to use the image of smaller size (if we measure in KB
                                then our new image is approximately 5 times smaller than the original one). <br/>
                                <strong>Correction:</strong>
                                The web page image was replaced with the image of a smaller size.
                                The new image file assets/serveimage_600x400.jpeg has been added.
                                The links to the image have been updated in index.html.
