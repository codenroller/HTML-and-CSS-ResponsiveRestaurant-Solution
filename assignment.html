                <h3>Part I: Test and Bug Fix !</h3>
                <p>
                    Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design which makes web pages render well
                    on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. In this part of the project we are going
                    to test our site behavior on screens of different sizes. If a developer finds out that the site is not
                    behaving nicely and responsively, then he/she is expected to investigate the issue and fix it.
                    Create a git repository for the project. You are expected to use Git and GitHub while working
                    on a project. Remember to add meaningful messages when making git commits!
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first task will be to test the site responsiveness on various screen resolutions,
                    and fix the bugs if any. Fix each bug separately. After the bug is fixed save changes to your
                    project git repository.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hint: The site does not behave responsively within a resolution range of 769px - 1300px.

                <h3> Part II: Working with Responsive Navigation Menu </h3>
                <p>
                    In this part of the project you will be dealing with the project navigation menu.
                    You are expected to add the following items to the menu:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assignment (instead of item1)</li>
                        <li>Solution (instead of item2)</li>
                        <li>Desktop First ! (instead of item3)</li>
                        <li>Mobile First ! (instead of item4)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Work on a separate git branch when modifying a menu, let's call it 'edit_menu'.
                    After you are happy with the look of your navigation menu submit changes to git
                    by merging the 'edit_menu' branch with the project master branch. Delete the
                    'edit_menu' branch after the merge.
                </p>

                <h3>Part III: Mobile First !</h3>
                <p>
                    If you look carefully at the code of the existing project, you will find out that
                    the web page was built using desktop-first (or graceful degradation) approach.
                    So your task is to rebuild the page using mobile first (or progressive enhancement)
                    approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Work on a separate git branch when working on mobile-first version of the web page.
                    After you are happy with the look submit the changes to git.
                </p>

                <h3>Part IV: Finalizing the Project</h3>
                <p>
                    Congratulations! You are almost done!
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is left to do is to add assignment and solution pages to your project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Copy the exercise assigment on the project assignment page. When a user clicks
                    the navigation button 'Assignment' he/she is supposed to be redirected to
                    the project assignment page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Create a project solution page. When a user clicks the navigation button 'Solution'
                    he/she is supposed to be redirected to the project solution page. On the solution
                    page you are expected to present the solution for the Part I. List all the bugs
                    that you managed to find and briefly explain how you fixed them. At the beginning
                    of the solution page place a link to your project git repository.
                </p>
